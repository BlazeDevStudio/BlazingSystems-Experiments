## Repository Layout

- **[experiment/](experiment/)** — larger system experiments, currently focused on OpenWrt
- **[embedded/](embedded/)** — ESP8266 firmware prototypes and versioned experiments
- **[android/](android/)** — Android + embedded integration prototypes
- **[web/](web/)** — browser runtime and compatibility research
- **[.github/workflows/](.github/workflows/)** — automated build/static-check workflows

## Research Standard

Experimental means the limitation is part of the documentation. A project should state what was tested, what remains uncertain, what hardware/platform it targets, and what evidence is required before promotion.

Versioned release snapshots are preserved rather than silently overwritten. Clean-room projects do not redistribute proprietary source, credentials, certificates or commercial payloads from systems they study.

## Publication Policy

Public experiments exclude employer/client records, private keys, production credentials, raw private backups, commercial ROM/APK/JAR payloads and proprietary operational datasets.

See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for repository-wide publication notes.
