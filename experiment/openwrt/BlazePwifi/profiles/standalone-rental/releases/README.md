# Standalone Rental Releases

## Provisioning candidate

### v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.10

RC10 fixes lease-credit mutation before signed policy verification, rejects stale/replayed policy revision or legacy-policy downgrade after a modern revision, persists newly verified policies durably, and blocks Device Owner compliance completion unless a subsequent authenticated policy sync succeeds. RC9 remains immutable. Physical provisioning and production signing are still required.


### v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.9

RC9 supersedes RC8 for further Device Provisioning validation. It pins the first
accepted pending provisioning identity (server origin + one-time token + certificate
pin), permits only exact Setup Wizard callback replay, rejects changed callback identity,
and adds an executable JUnit regression matrix. RC8 remains immutable.

- Android package identity: `0.5.2-rental.2-rc.9`, versionCode `50210`.
- TEST-signed provisioning APK only; production signing continuity is unchanged.
- Physical Setup Wizard validation remains required before stable promotion.

### v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.8

RC8 supersedes RC7 for further provisioning validation without modifying the immutable RC7 tag.

Additional RC8 hardening:
- stable-promotion gate verifies the **actual APK signer certificate** through `apksigner verify --print-certs`; signer metadata alone is not trusted;
- release metadata carries explicit `TARGET_SCOPE`;
- non-approved custom DPCs are restricted to `aosp_non_gms_or_explicit_oem_only`;
- GMS-approved DPC metadata must use `gms_and_supported_aosp`;
- physical validation evidence must match the exact target scope and signer identity;
- a non-GMS-approved release must explicitly record that no universal GMS compatibility claim is being made;
- Android package identity is `0.5.2-rental.2-rc.8`, versionCode `50209`.

### v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.7

RC7 supersedes RC6 for physical provisioning testing without modifying the immutable RC6 tag.

Additional RC7 hardening:
- strict OpenWrt Rental Server authority validation before either QR is generated;
- numeric port bounds (1-65535) and bracketed IPv6 handling;
- rejection of missing host, malformed IPv6, userinfo, path, query, fragment, backslash, whitespace and control-character origins;
- BlazeRental repeats origin and TLS-pin checks inside the persistence boundary, independent of the scanner;
- Android package identity is `0.5.2-rental.2-rc.7`, versionCode `50208`.


### v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.6

RC6 supersedes RC5 for testing without modifying the immutable RC5 tag.

Additional hardening:
- Android provisioning callbacks are idempotent when Setup Wizard redelivers identical extras;
- an already-bound phone cannot silently destroy its permanent identity by scanning a new Standard Enrollment QR;
- administrators must use the explicit Transfer action before rebinding;
- Standard Enrollment scanner errors distinguish Device Provisioning QR, already-bound state, and local-storage failure;
- Android package identity is `0.5.2-rental.2-rc.6`, versionCode `50207`.

### v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.5

RC5 supersedes RC4 for testing. It keeps the separated Standard Enrollment / Device Provisioning architecture and closes the first-enrollment transport exposure:

- Standard Enrollment schema `blazerental.enrollment.v2`;
- Device Provisioning admin-extras schema `blazerental.provisioning.v2`;
- enrollment protocol 2 derives the long-lived device secret from the one-time token, nonce and server-issued device ID;
- the long-lived device secret is not transmitted over LAN HTTP;
- the APK verifies an HMAC-signed enrollment response before storing identity;
- the consumed one-time enrollment secret is removed from local storage;
- Android package identity is `0.5.2-rental.2-rc.5`, versionCode `50206`.

### v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.4

RC4 keeps the separated Standard Enrollment / Device Provisioning architecture, requires administrator role for Device Provisioning QR generation, and fixes canonical padded Base64URL checksum parsing in the immutable release assembler.

### v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.3

RC3 supersedes RC2 without modifying older tags/assets.

Key hardening:
- canonical padded Base64URL APK checksum for Android Setup Wizard;
- exact APK SHA-256 + signer-certificate SHA-256 published in release evidence;
- OpenWrt tar/OneClick and EW1200G/x86 firmware share the same exact provisioning metadata generator;
- explicit `GMS_DPC_APPROVED` state and API/UI acknowledgement gate;
- non-approved custom DPC QR is labeled for AOSP/non-GMS or explicitly supported test targets only;
- Standard Enrollment and Device Provisioning remain separate contracts.

### v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.2

Atomic one-time enrollment claims, release-package TEST APK identity, and executable provisioning/race CI.

### v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.1

First published provisioning split candidate; preserved unchanged.
