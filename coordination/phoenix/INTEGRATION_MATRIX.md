## 3. Mandatory Integration Gates

Every change affecting money, cryptographic state, or physical actuation must progress sequentially through the following numbered gates:

### Gate 1: Source-Contract Definition & Non-Overlapping PRs
- Changes must reside in a dedicated role branch matching `ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS.md`.
- No single PR may alter both client UI and server accounting scripts.
- Handover ledgers (`PROJECT_HANDOVER.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `CHANGE_LEDGER.md`) must be synchronized with the commit.

### Gate 2: Lab & CI Verification on Exact SHA
- Source-exact commit must pass all automated linters, static checks (`static.sh`, `config.sh`), and compiler warnings-as-errors.
- Negative tests must be demonstrated: the failure must reproduce (RED) on baseline and resolve (GREEN) on candidate.
- Evidence links must cite exact GitHub Actions run and job IDs.

### Gate 3: Peer & QA Independent Verification
- Financial, cryptographic, and migration changes require independent review by `PHX-QA` and `PHX-MASTER`.
- `PHX-QA` verifies the identical git commit SHA using independent test fixtures without shared mutable state.

### Gate 4: Hardware & Physical Acceptance (P0 Gate #34)
- **150 Real Power-Cut Trials:** Abrupt power termination during active coin insertion and member transfer; journal must recover cleanly with zero corrupt receipts or phantom balance.
- **30-Device 24-Hour Soak:** 30 physical client nodes (mix of Android rental devices and Windows SoftTimer stations) running concurrent sessions under full traffic.
- **Physical Coin Ingress Validation:** Real mechanical coin selectors (multi-coin and single-coin) tested across denominations.

### Gate 5: Production Release Authorization (Master Gate)
- Formal approval by `PHX-MASTER`.
- Verification of authentic production code-signing certificates and anti-rollback witness.
- Final tag and manifest generation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Active Gating Notice:**  
> Gates 1, 2, and 3 are actively running in lab and CI workflows. Gates 4 and 5 remain **CLOSED (NO-GO)**. No production releases, flashing, or customer migrations are authorized.
