## 1. Executive Summary & Production Gate Status

Project Phoenix is under active, rigorous multi-agent and developer coordination. In strict compliance with `AGENTS.md` and the Master Development Directive:
- **Commercial & Production Status:** **STRICT NO-GO**.
- **Financial Cutover:** **NO-GO** pending independent durable accounting and anti-rollback witness.
- **Hardware Flashing:** **NO-GO** pending 150 power-cut tests and 30-device 24-hour soak.
- **Merge Restrictions:** All safety-critical PRs must remain as **DRAFT** until full gate clearance.

## 2. Historical P0 Blockers Triage Against Current HEAD

| Issue | Title | Classification | Ground Truth & Evidence Citations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[#31](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/issues/31)** | Durable prepaid event idempotency & crash-atomic member transfers | **OPEN / LAB REPRODUCED RED** | Test fixture [PR #222](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/pull/222) ([Run #40451461476](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/actions/runs/40451461476)) reproduces confirmed controller-admission vulnerability where a fresh transfer ACKs despite controller being disabled between fd7/fd9. Candidate fix staged in [PR #241](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/pull/241) and [PR #252](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/pull/252) using fd4 serialization lock. |
| **[#32](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/issues/32)** | Rental coin lease and receipt divergence on crash | **OPEN / KNOWN UNRESOLVED** | Installed `rental.sh` in `experiment/openwrt/BlazePwifi/openwrt/rootfs/usr/lib/blazepwifi/` executes `bp_rental_device_write` followed by `bp_rental_append_paid_receipt` as distinct durable operations. Atomic single-journal commit required. |
| **[#43](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/issues/43)** | Independent prepaid-ledger freshness witness | **OPEN / UNKNOWN** | Evaluated via simulation models in CI (job `125297115375`); physical hardware TPM or secure enclave witness not yet provisioned. |
| **[#34](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/issues/34)** | Real hardware power-cut (150 trials), 30-device soak, financial migration acceptance | **OPEN / NEEDS-HARDWARE** | Laboratory and CI passed synthetic tests, but physical hardware acceptance cannot be established through cloud CI. Production release blocked. |
| **[#164](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/issues/164)** | Optional MCU-free serial coin input (Windows & OpenWrt) | **OPEN / LAB VERIFIED** | Windows SoftTimer `GUID_DEVINTERFACE_COMPORT` transport implemented in [PR #255](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/pull/255); session-atomic CTS pulse correction implemented in [PR #238](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/pull/238). Physical serial stress testing outstanding. |
| **[#177](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/issues/177)** | Coin pulse missed during 3.5s synchronous ESP Vendo poll | **OPEN / LAB VERIFIED** | Hardware firmware hardening completed in [PR #283](https://github.com/BlazeDevStudio/BlazingSystems-Experiments/pull/283) (signed response verification, 64-bit hardware RNG nonces, LittleFS `/quarantine.log` coin quarantine). Physical electronic bench testing pending. |

## 4. Immediate Master Directives & Integration Roadmap

1. **Maintain Role Separation:**
   Each worker must strictly operate within their owned scope defined in `ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS.md`. No cross-subsystem file modifications without explicit Master sign-off.
2. **Reconcile Core Finance Lock (P0 #31):**
   `PHX-CORE` and `PHX-QA` must verify that PR #241 (fd4 serialization lock) passes the real signed CGI regression from PR #222 while preserving idempotent replay of previously committed receipts.
3. **Firmware Verification (HW-P0-1 & HW-P0-2):**
   `PHX-HARDWARE` PR #283 must be maintained in DRAFT until non-customer bench hardware logs verify LittleFS quarantine behavior under simulated link failure.
4. **Windows SoftTimer Stability:**
   `PHX-PISONET` must integrate `TimeCreditMath.TryAdd` (PR #268) with the same-owned-handle COM transport (PR #255) and verify warning-free compilation.
5. **No Production Release:**
   Under all circumstances, production gates remain firmly closed until physical acceptance criteria are fulfilled.
